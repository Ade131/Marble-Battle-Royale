Photon Fusion Simple KCC Addon - Release History

Last tested with Fusion SDK 2.0.0-RC3-807

Version 2.0.6
- Fixed stuck on the edge when finishing step-up.
- Added input accumulators - FloatAccumulator, Vector2Accumulator, Vector3Accumulator.
    - These classes support accumulation of raw values, their smoothing and tick-aligned delta consumption.
    - Typical use-case is accumulation of mouse delta passed through a network struct.
    - The tick-aligned accumulation ensures that snapshot interpolated value in Render() will be smooth.
- Fixed downward sphere cast check in step-up.
- Added SimpleKCC.ProjectOnGround(). This is useful when calculating XZ input => XYZ velocity to move along ground tangent.

Version 2.0.5
Important
============================================================
! Simple KCC proxy is no longer simulated by default. If you call Runner.SetIsSimulated(Object, true) from other script, the KCC will behave as predicted.
! Jump impulse vector in Move() function converted to float => XZ is not supported.
! Gravity vector in SetGravity() function converted to float => XZ is not supported.

Changes
============================================================
- Added gizmos when KCC is selected.
- Added KCCSettings.ForcePredictedLookRotation - skips look rotation interpolation in render for local character and can be used for extra look responsiveness with other properties being interpolated.
- Added KCCSettings.ProxyInterpolation - controls interpolations of networked properties from network buffer, and propagation to Collider, Transform and Rigidbody components.
- Added KCCSettings.CompressNetworkPosition - optional network traffic reduction for non-player characters. Full precision position is synchronized by default.
- Improved step detection configuration (added min push-back to trigger step-up, toggle to require ground target point, variable ground check radius). Backport from Advanced KCC 2.0.
- Removed Runner.SetIsSimulated(Object, true) from KCC - proxies are no longer simulated.
- Removed networked keep-alive flag.
- Performance optimizations for proxies.
- Fixed projection of depenetration vector, resulting in jitter on slopes.

Version 2.0.4
- Changed root namespace from Fusion.SimpleKCC to Fusion.Addons.SimpleKCC.

Version 2.0.3
- Performance and network traffic optimizations.
- Fixed interpolation in Shared Mode.
- Added support for position and rotation handles.
- Compatibility with latest Fusion SDK.

Version 2.0.2
- Performance optimizations.

Version 2.0.1
- Exposed KCC Settings.

Version 2.0.0
- Initial release.
