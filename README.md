# Marble Battle Royale

## Introduction
Marble Battle Royale is an online multiplayer physics-based game developed in Unity. This project showcases networked game development techniques using Photon Fusion, emphasizing real-time multiplayer interactions and physics synchronization.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: Utilized as the primary game engine to create and manage game scenes, physics simulations, and user interactions.
- **Photon Fusion**: Implemented for its abstract networking capabilities, allowing for real-time multiplayer gameplay.
- **C#**: All game logic and network event handling are scripted using C#.
- **Networked Physics**: Integrates Unity's physics engine with Photon Fusion to ensure that all interactions and movements are accurately synchronized across all players.
